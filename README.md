# Test Your Memory - jQuery Web App
### Description

Test Your Memory - It is a form of recalling an object displayed in a particular environment. This app let the user interact with the environment (grid boxes here), recall the positions. Here I used css-grids to display the boxes. This project required to have user interface, DOM manipulation and jQuery. 

### Project features

* Responsive design
* Uses css-grid dynamically
* DOM manipulation with addition and deletion of boxes in the grid
* Interesting sound effects for win and loose.
* Two levels to play the game (Easy and Hard).
* Simplicity wrapped in complex css-grid.
* Animation on click and hover events.
* Accessibility, boxes could be accessed through keyboard tabbing.
* Use of [sweetAlert2.js](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) library for displaying intersting alerts.
